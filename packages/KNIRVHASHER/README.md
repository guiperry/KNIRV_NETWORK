</p>

## Overview

HASHER implements a recursive single-ASIC inference engine as specified in the **HASHER_SDD.md** document. This package transforms obsolete Bitcoin mining hardware (like Antminer S2/S3) into a novel machine learning inference system by using SHA-256 ASIC chips as computational primitives for neural network operations.

**Updated Algorithm:** The system now uses the ASIC as a **deterministic bucket generator** rather than a generic hash function. By setting a "Difficulty 1" target, we use the first valid Nonce discovered as the LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) signature, maintaining the 500 GH/s speed advantage by repurposing the mining hardware's natural state.

**Training Innovation:** Discovery of "Golden Seeds" is now optimized using a **Hamming Similarity Gradient** in the evolutionary process. Instead of binary prefix matching, the system rewards total matching bits across the 32-bit word, providing a continuous signal for convergence even at high difficulties.

## Key Features

### 1. Hash-Based Neural Network
- **Hash Neurons**: Individual neurons using SHA-256 as activation function with cryptographic seed "weights"
- **Multi-Layer Architecture**: Input layer → Hidden Layer 1 (128 neurons) → Hidden Layer 2 (64 neurons) → Output Layer (variable)
- **Efficient Serialization**: Network configurations can be serialized to/from JSON

### 2. Recursive Inference Engine
- **Temporal Ensemble Learning**: Virtualizes distributed mesh architecture as a time-series process on a single ASIC
- **Adaptive Jitter**: Applies controlled input jitter for robustness
- **Seed Rotation**: Rotates neuron seeds for each inference pass to create diverse temporal ensemble
- **Optimal Pass Count**: Default of 21 passes based on performance analysis

### 3. Logical Validation
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Stores and retrieves logical rules per domain
- **Constraint Validation**: Checks predictions against predefined constraints
- **Subsumption & Disjointness**: Validates logical consistency using rule-based reasoning
- **Domain-Specific Rules**: Default rules for anomaly detection and classification domains

### 4. Temporal Consensus
- **Aggregation**: Collects results from multiple passes
- **Voting System**: Determines consensus prediction using majority voting
- **Confidence Calculation**: Computes confidence scores and statistical summary
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles failed passes and invalid inputs

## 🔐 Updated Algorithm: Nonce-Mining for LSH

### Hardware Reality Pivot

The ASIC is designed for Bitcoin mining (finding nonces where SHA256(SHA256(header+nonce)) < target), but the HASHER needs deterministic hashing (SHA256(input || seed) → fixed output). The original design assumed the BM1382 could perform arbitrary SHA-256 hashes. Testing has confirmed the ASIC is hard-wired for the Bitcoin mining loop.

**Revised Core Innovation:** Instead of using the ASIC as a hash function, HASHER now uses it as a **deterministic bucket generator**. By setting a "Difficulty 1" target, we use the first valid **Nonce** discovered as the LSH signature. This maintains the 500 GH/s speed advantage by repurposing the mining hardware's natural state.

### From Hashing to Mining

We pack the 128-bit LSH projections into the standard 80-byte Bitcoin block header structure to be processed by the `0x52 (TXTASK)` protocol.

**Header Mapping:**

* **Version (4 bytes):** Used as a "Salt" or Seed for the LSH forest.
* **Previous Block Hash (32 bytes):** Stores the first 4 LSH projections (4x32-bit floats).
* **Merkle Root (32 bytes):** Stores the next 4 LSH projections.
* **Timestamp/Bits (8 bytes):** Fixed metadata to ensure determinism.
* **Nonce (4 bytes):** The output we seek from the ASIC.

### Temporal Recursive Nonces

To handle the **61MB RAM constraint**, we implement a **Temporal Recursive Algorithm**. If a bucket collision occurs, we "mine deeper" by using the previously found nonce as a seed for the next task.

**Multi-Nonce Signature:**

Instead of one 128-bit signature, we collect the first N nonces that satisfy the target.

* **LSH Bucket ID:** Determined by the first valid nonce
* **Rerank Filter:** Uses subsequent nonces for fine-grained similarity
* **Determinism Guarantee:** We specify a `Nonce Range` (e.g., 0 to 1,000,000). The ASIC will always find the same "Golden Nonce" for the same projection data within that range.

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | Original Design | Updated Design (Mining) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hashing Latency** | 100µs (Direct) | ~1-2ms (Mining Search + USB) |
| **Determinism** | High (SHA-256) | High (First Nonce in Range) |
| **CPU Load** | Moderate | Low (Header packing is simple math) |
| **RAM Usage** | 61MB | 61MB (No change, uses mmap index) |

**Bottleneck Analysis:**
The primary bottleneck is no longer SHA-256 computation, but the **USB Bulk Transfer** and the **time-to-first-nonce**. At 500 GH/s, the hardware finds a Difficulty 1 nonce in nanoseconds, meaning the total search time remains dominated by the network call to the API server (~42ms).

func BuildMiningHeader(projections []float32, salt uint32) []byte {
    header := make([]byte, 80)
    
    // Version (Salt)
    binary.LittleEndian.PutUint32(header[0:4], salt)
    
    // Previous Block Hash (Projections 0-7)
    for i := 0; i < 8; i++ {
        val := math.Float32bits(projections[i])
        binary.LittleEndian.PutUint32(header[4+(i*4):8+(i*4)], val)
    }
    
    // Merkle Root (Projections 8-15)
    for i := 0; i < 8; i++ {
        val := math.Float32bits(projections[8+i])
        binary.LittleEndian.PutUint32(header[36+(i*4):40+(i*4)], val)
    }

    // Fixed Difficulty Bits (0x1d00ffff = Difficulty 1)
    binary.LittleEndian.PutUint32(header[72:76], 0x1d00ffff)
    
    return header
}
```

## CLI Usage

The Hasher CLI provides an interactive terminal interface for managing ASIC devices, running diagnostics, and performing inference. Built with Bubble Tea, it features a modern TUI with real-time logs, chat interface, and menu navigation.

### Starting the CLI

```bash
# Build and run
make cli
./bin/hasher

# Or run directly
make run-cli
```

The CLI automatically starts the `hasher-host` orchestrator in the background and displays initialization logs in a blue bordered view while the server starts up.

### Menu Structure

The CLI uses a hierarchical menu system with a **Primary Menu** and an **ASIC Configuration submenu**.

#### Primary Menu

The main menu provides top-level access to HASHER functionality:

| Option | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **1** | Data Pipeline | Run the data processing pipeline (miner → encoder → trainer) |
| **2** | ASIC Config | Open ASIC configuration submenu (Discovery, Probe, Provision, etc.) |
| **3** | Test Chat | Interactive chat interface for hasher-based inference |
| **0** | Quit | Exit the application |

#### ASIC Configuration Submenu

Accessed by selecting **Option 2 (ASIC Config)** from the Primary Menu:

| Option | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|

### Data Pipeline Workflow

The Data Pipeline (**Primary Menu → Option 1**) automates the complete data processing workflow:

```
Data Miner → Data Encoder → Data Trainer
```

**Pipeline Stages:**

1. **Data Miner** (⛏️)
   - Processes documents and PDFs
   - Structures raw data for ML pipelines
   - Reaches quota automatically

2. **Data Encoder** (🔐)
   - Performs tokenization
   - Generates embeddings
   - Prepares training data

3. **Data Trainer** (🧠)
   - Trains neural networks
   - Optimizes model weights
   - Completes training cycle

**Pipeline View Features:**
- Real-time progress bar showing overall completion
- Stage status indicators (⏳ Pending / ▶️ Running / ✅ Complete)
- Log output display in blue bordered view
- Automatic progression between stages
- Press `ESC` to return to menu at any time

The pipeline runs each program from `~/.local/share/hasher/bin/` in sequence, waiting for each to reach its quota before starting the next.

### Workflow Example

Typical workflow for setting up a new ASIC device:

```
Primary Menu:
  2. ASIC Config → Opens ASIC Configuration submenu

ASIC Configuration Menu:
  1. Discovery   → Finds ASIC devices on network
  2. Probe       → Gathers device information
  3. Protocol    → Detects communication protocol
  4. Provision   → Deploys hasher-server binary
  8. Test        → Verifies ASIC communication
  9. Back        → Return to Primary Menu

Primary Menu:
  3. Test Chat   → Starts inference with ASIC
```

### Real-time Monitoring

The CLI displays real-time information in the header and footer:

- **Header**: Server status, ASIC device IP
- **Footer**: CPU usage, RAM usage, Go version, device type
- **Blue Box**: Initialization logs, pipeline logs
- **Chat View**: Conversation history and server logs

### CLI Configuration

The CLI stores embedded binaries in:
- `~/.local/share/hasher/bin/` (Linux)
- `~/Library/Application Support/hasher/bin/` (macOS)
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hasher\bin\` (Windows)

Environment file (`.env`) is automatically copied to the bin directory if found in the project root.

### Creating and Using a Hash Network

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "hasher/internal/hasher"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new hash network (MNIST dimensions)
    net, err := hasher.NewHashNetwork(784, 128, 64, 10)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Error creating network: %v\n", err)
        return
    }

    // Create recursive engine with optimal parameters
    engine, err := hasher.NewRecursiveEngine(net, 21, 0.01, true)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Error creating engine: %v\n", err)
        return
    }

    // Example input (would be normalized image data in real scenario)
    input := make([]byte, 784)
    for i := range input {
        input[i] = byte(i % 256)
    }

    // Perform inference
    result, err := engine.Infer(input)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Error during inference: %v\n", err)
        return
    }

    // Print results
    fmt.Printf("Inference completed in %v\n", result.Latency)
    fmt.Printf("Valid passes: %d/%d\n", result.ValidPasses, result.TotalPasses)
    fmt.Printf("Consensus prediction: %d (confidence: %.2f)\n", 
        result.Consensus.Prediction, result.Consensus.Confidence)
    
    // Get statistical summary
    summary := result.StatisticalSummary()
    fmt.Printf("Mean confidence: %.3f, Std Dev: %.3f\n", 
        summary.MeanConfidence, summary.ConfidenceStdDev)
}
```

### Adding Custom Logical Rules

```go
func addCustomRules() {
    validator, _ := hasher.NewLogicalValidator()
    
    // Add custom constraint rule for temperature sensor data
    rule, _ := hasher.NewLogicalRule(
        "constraint",
        []string{"prediction > -40", "prediction < 85"},
        "Valid temperature range",
        "Temperature must be between -40°C and 85°C"
    )
    
    validator.KnowledgeBase.AddRule("temperature_sensing", rule)
}
```

## MATHASHER: Deterministic Mathematical Verification

HASHER now includes the **MATHASHER** extension - a deterministic mathematical verification layer that addresses the "Broken arXiv" problem of LLM hallucination in long-form derivations.

### Key Features

#### 1. Math-Domain Bitmask Specification
The system uses specialized bitmasks for Slot 4 (Grammar) and Slot 10 (Domain) when operating in Math Mode:

| Slot 4 (Math POS) | Role | Description |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| `0x01` | VARIABLE | Symbolic placeholders (x, y, θ, α) |
| `0x02` | OPERATOR | Arithmetic or logical actions (+, -, ∫, Σ) |
| `0x03` | INTEGER | Constant whole numbers (1, 2, 42) |
| `0x04` | DECIMAL | Floating-point values (3.14, 0.5) |
| `0x05` | FUNCTION | Named operations (sin, log, lim) |
| `0x06` | DELIMITER | Structural boundaries ( (, ), [ ] ) |
| `0x07` | RELATION | Comparative logic (=, <, ≈, ≡) |
| `0x08` | EXPONENT | Power indicators (^2, √) |

| Slot 10 (Domain) | Sub-Domain |
|:---:|:---|
| `0x2000` | Arithmetic |
| `0x2100` | Algebra |
| `0x2200` | Calculus |
| `0x2300` | Statistics |
| `0x2400` | Logic/Set |

#### 2. LaTeX-to-Tensor Mapper
Converts mathematical expressions into the 12-slot neural frame:

```go
mapper := math.NewLaTeXMapper(math.SUB_calculus)
slots := mapper.MapLaTeXToTensor("\\int_0^1 x^2 dx", math.SUB_calculus)
// Returns [12]uint32 with domain locked to 0x2200
```

#### 3. Inference Watchdog
Validates mathematical derivation steps against bitmask constraints:

```go
watchdog := math.NewInferenceWatchdog(math.SUB_algebra)
result := watchdog.ValidateMathStep(0, slots)
// Returns ValidationResult with LogicIntegrity score
```

#### 4. HashNet Plugin API
REST endpoint for mathematical verification:

```json
POST /v1/verify/math
{
  "context": "Integrating f(x) = x^2 from 0 to 3",
  "proposition": "\\int_0^3 x^2 dx = 9",
  "subdomain": "0x2200"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "VERIFIED",
  "nonce": "0xABC12345",
  "logic_integrity": 0.99,
  "latency_ms": 2.4
}
```

#### 5. Math-Logic Dataset Miner
Ingest mathematical proofs from Lean, OpenWebMath, or arXiv:

```go
mined, err := api.MineMathDataset("input.json", "output.parquet", math.SUB_calculus)
```

### Usage

```bash
# Verify a mathematical expression
go run cmd/cli/main.go math-verify "x + y = z" --subdomain algebra

# Run tests
go test -v ./pkg/hashing/math/...

# Build with math-logic support
make cli MATH=true
```

### Why MATHASHER?

Traditional LLMs treat math as "likely sequence of characters" - they drift into probabilistic guessing. MATHASHER treats math as a cryptographically signed path where every "=" requires a verified Golden Nonce.

| Feature | Standard LLM | MATHASHER |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Math Execution | Probabilistic | **Cryptographic** |
| Logic Guardrails | Self-correction fails | **Hard-coded Bitmasks** |
| Verification | Black box | **Golden Nonce Proof** |

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Z3 Integration**: Full integration with Z3 theorem prover for advanced logical reasoning
2. **Dynamic Learning**: Online learning from ground truth comparisons
3. **Adaptive Pass Count**: Adjust number of passes based on confidence levels
4. **Model Pruning**: Optimize network structure for specific tasks
5. **Header Verification**: Flash modified `cgminer` to verify Go-built headers are accepted by BM1382
6. **Nonce Stability Test**: Run same vector through multiple Antminers to verify consistent "First Nonce"
